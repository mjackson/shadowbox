The Shadowbox language files in this directory contain translations of several
simple phrases that are useful in helping users navigate the Shadowbox interface
and obtain plugins when necessary.

If you do not see the language you would like to use represented here, please
feel free to create your own translation. Since the English file is the original
you will probably want to base your translation on it.

You should name the file with a suffix that corresponds to the language code
found in the GNU documentation:
