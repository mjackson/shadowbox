YUICompressor
=============

YUICompressor is a Ruby module that may be used to create compressed versions
of JavaScript and CSS code quickly and easily using the Yahoo User Interface
(YUI) library compressor. The module is essentially a wrapper around the YUI
Compressor (a Java library) that supports two different modes of operation:
shell and native.

In shell mode the YUI Compressor library executes in a separate process. Code
is piped into and out of this process using the system shell. This approach
yields good performance and is the default for MRI and other Ruby versions that
are not able to execute Java code.

In native mode the compressor is invoked in the same process as Ruby. This is
only possible when using YUICompressor on JRuby. With this approach, compression
speeds dramatically improve because the system does not incur the overhead of
invoking a separate Java process for each compression.

In any case YUICompressor will automatically detect the Ruby platform it is
running on and choose the mode that will offer the best performance.

The inspiration for this project is Sam Stephenson's yui-compressor gem. The
goal of YUICompressor is to provide a more fluent interface, greater
flexibility, and better performance than its predecessor.


Installation
------------

Via RubyGems:

    $ gem install yuicompressor

From a local copy:

    $ git clone git://github.com/mjijackson/yuicompressor.git
    $ cd yuicompressor
    $ rake package && rake install

Usage
-----

The easiest way to compress JavaScript code using YUICompressor is to pass an IO
or a string containing your code to YUICompressor.compress_js. Similarly, CSS
code may similarly be compressed using YUICompressor.compress_css. Both methods
may take a second parameter that is a Hash of options to use during compression.
When compressing CSS, the following option is available:

    :line_break     The maximum number of characters that may appear in a
                    single line of compressed code. Defaults to no maximum
                    length. If set to 0 each line will be the minimum length
                    possible.

When compressing JavaScript, these additional options are available:

    :munge                  Should be +true+ if the compressor should shorten
                            local variable names when possible. Defaults to
                            +false+.
    :preserve_semicolons    Should be +true+ if the compressor should preserve
                            all semicolons in the code. Defaults to +false+.
    :optimize               Should be +true+ if the compressor should enable all
                            micro optimizations. Defaults to +true+.

When running in shell mode (i.e. not on JRuby) a :java option may be used to
specify the path to the Java binary. The default value is "java".

Examples
--------

JavaScript compression:

    require 'yuicompressor'
    js = '(function () { var abc = {}; abc["key"] = "value"; })()'
    YUICompressor.compress_js(js)
     => "(function(){var abc={};abc.key=\"value\"})();"

JavaScript compression with shortened local variable names (i.e. munging):

    require 'yuicompressor'
    js = '(function () { var abc = {}; abc["key"] = "value"; })()'
    YUICompressor.compress_js(js, :munge => true)
     => "(function(){var a={};a.key=\"value\"})();"

CSS compression:

    require 'yuicompressor'
    css = <<'CODE'
    div.main {
      background-position: 0;
    }
    h1#title {
      color: #FFFFFF;
    }
    CODE
    YUICompressor.compress_css(css)
     => "div.main{background-position:0 0;}h1#title{color:#FFF;}"

CSS compression with every statement on a separate line:

    require 'yuicompressor'
    css = <<'CODE'
    div.main {
      background-position: 0;
    }
    h1#title {
      color: #FFFFFF;
    }
    CODE
    YUICompressor.compress_css(css, :line_break => 0)
     => "div.main{background-position:0 0;}\nh1#title{color:#FFF;}"

Including in another module:

    require 'yuicompressor'

    module MyJavaScriptCompressor
      include YUICompressor

      def compress(code)
        compress_js(code)
      end
    end
